                <p>This internship was a tremendous learning experience for me. In the initial days, we engaged in some manual tasks. However, my friend and I noticed that they were facing issues with Arduino boards. We took the initiative to offer our assistance in programming these Arduinos. As a result, we successfully completed two projects over a period of six months. The first project involved developing an ABS brake simulation for technical high school students, while the second project focused on creating a sensor education kit for universities.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the ABS brake simulation project, we utilized motors that needed to be controlled with Arduino in order to simulate an ABS brake system.</li>
                  <li>In the sensor education kit project, we designed a comprehensive system consisting of 36 sensors distributed across 4 different boards. Additionally, we developed a main machine that displayed the outputs from these sensors. My friend and I took the responsibility of programming each sensor and designing the four sensor boards.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This internship became the pivotal point where I began my journey in programming. While still in high school, I had the opportunity to participate in summer internships, and my school arranged for me to join this particular company. Upon arrival, they asked me about my interests, and I expressed my desire to learn programming. One of the engineers suggested that I start by learning Python and assigned me tasks to enhance my understanding. Initially, the tasks focused on sorting algorithms, but as I progressed, I delved into socket programming and even developed a messaging app. This experience laid the foundation for my programming skills and ignited my passion for the field. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I also learned PowerShell during that time, specifically for scripting Python applications.</li>
                  <li>Python consumed most of my time during this internship as I dedicated myself to learning its fundamentals. I completed numerous tasks aimed at grasping the basics of programming.</li>
                  <li>After acquiring proficiency in Python, I set out to develop a messaging application. To achieve this, I focused on learning how to establish TCP servers and clients.</li>

                          <p>While I was engaged in building drones at university, I had the opportunity to provide online Arduino lessons. As I was interested in gaining teaching experience, I gladly accepted the opportunity. The experience turned out to be positive, as I successfully conducted a total of 12 lessons and uploaded them to YouTube. Overall, these lessons provided me with a valuable and fulfilling teaching experience.</p>

                          <p>During my high school days, our main project was to build line follower robots. We invested significant effort into this endeavor, and by the end of the year, we achieved success in creating line follower robots with PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. This marked my first encounter with PID control, and I was able to grasp its concepts at the age of 16. Subsequently, we participated in competitions with our robots. </p>
